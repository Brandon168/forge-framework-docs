# Differentiators from Other Frameworks

Forge Framework's theory of operation is very similar to that of Magento; build a fully
functional platform that is customizable and upgradable. The intended workflow is for a
consumer to choose the modules he wants, install them, then customize as needed.

Forge Framework aims to differentiate itself from other platforms in a number of ways:

* **Clear and complete documentation** - Since Zend Frramework 2 is used as a base and is
  already well documented, Forge Framework has a strong foundation for documentation
* **Focused on interoperability** - All Forge Framework functionality is written with clear
  interfaces and defined injection points for subsystems to be replaced with external systems
* **Performance and Scalability** - Performance and Scalability are considered with every line
  of code added to the codebase
* **Mobile First and Content Driven Responsive Design** - Information Architecture and Visual
  Design for all Forge Framework functionality is built with many different device experiences
  in mind
* **Hybrid of Responsive and Mobile** - Responsive design can't handle everything. There are
  instances where the mobile experience must be explicitly different or where certain content
  is superfluous to the page and does not need to be served. Forge Framework allows for
  specific device experiences to be targeted from a server point of view; not just on the
  frontend.
* **Ease of Upgrades** - The architecture of the platform is such that upgrades are easy, even
  with customizations
* **Well Defined Coding Standards** - Forge Framework follows ZF2 coding
  standards which are PSR standards based. A standard exists for a reason and we see no reason
  to be different here.
* **Documented Best Practices** - Best practices on module creation, functionality
  customization and other tasks will be explicitly documented. There will generally always be
  a recommended approach for any particular task.
* **Strong Error Handling and Debugging Tools** - Forge Framework's error handling can be
  turned up to 11. Zend_Log is leveraged to allow for logging based on priority to many
  different outputs. We plan to support automatic bug creation even in popular bug tracking
  platforms like Jira or Bugzilla.
